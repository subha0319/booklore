## 🐳 Deploy with Docker

You can quickly set up and run BookLore using Docker.

### 1️⃣ Install Docker & Docker Compose

Ensure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

**Image Repositories:**

- Docker Hub: `https://hub.docker.com/r/booklore/booklore`
- GitHub Container Registry: `https://ghcr.io/booklore-app/booklore`

> **Note:** Legacy images under `https://ghcr.io/adityachandelgit/booklore-app` will remain available but will not receive new updates.

### 2️⃣ Set Up Your docker-compose.yml Configuration

**Step 1: Create a `.env` file** in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml`:

```ini
# BookLore Application Settings
APP_USER_ID=0
APP_GROUP_ID=0
TZ=Etc/UTC
BOOKLORE_PORT=6060

# Database Connection (BookLore)
DATABASE_URL=jdbc:mariadb://mariadb:3306/booklore
DB_USER=booklore
DB_PASSWORD=ChangeMe_BookLoreApp_2025!

# MariaDB Container Settings
DB_USER_ID=1000
DB_GROUP_ID=1000
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=ChangeMe_MariaDBRoot_2025!
MYSQL_DATABASE=booklore
```

**Step 2: Create a `docker-compose.yml` file** that references the `.env` variables:

```yaml
services:
  booklore:
    image: booklore/booklore:latest
    # Alternative: Use GitHub Container Registry
    # image: ghcr.io/booklore-app/booklore:latest
    container_name: booklore
    environment:
      - USER_ID=${APP_USER_ID}
      - GROUP_ID=${APP_GROUP_ID}
      - TZ=${TZ}
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
      - DATABASE_USERNAME=${DB_USER}
      - DATABASE_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
      - BOOKLORE_PORT=${BOOKLORE_PORT}
    depends_on:
      mariadb:
        condition: service_healthy
    ports:
      - "${BOOKLORE_PORT}:${BOOKLORE_PORT}"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
      - ./books:/books
      - ./bookdrop:/bookdrop
    restart: unless-stopped

  mariadb:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/mariadb:11.4.5
    container_name: mariadb
    environment:
      - PUID=${DB_USER_ID}
      - PGID=${DB_GROUP_ID}
      - TZ=${TZ}
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=${MYSQL_DATABASE}
      - MYSQL_USER=${DB_USER}
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - ./mariadb/config:/config
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD", "mariadb-admin", "ping", "-h", "localhost" ]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 10
```

### 3️⃣ Start the Containers

Run the following command to start the services:

```ini
docker compose up -d
```

### 4️⃣ Access BookLore

Once the containers are up, access BookLore in your browser at:

```ini
http://localhost:6060
```

## 📥 Bookdrop Folder: Auto-Import Files

BookLore now supports a **Bookdrop folder**, a special directory where you can drop your book files (`.pdf`, `.epub`, `.cbz`, etc.), and BookLore will automatically detect, process, and prepare them for import. This makes it easy to bulk add new books without manually uploading each one.

### 🔍 How It Works

1. **File Watcher:** A background process continuously monitors the Bookdrop folder.
2. **File Detection:** When new files are added, BookLore automatically reads them and extracts basic metadata (title, author, etc.) from filenames or embedded data.
3. **Optional Metadata Fetching:** If enabled, BookLore can query metadata sources like Google Books or Open Library to enrich the book information.
4. **Review & Finalize:** You can then review the detected books in the Bookdrop UI, edit metadata if needed, and assign each book to a library and folder structure before finalizing the import.

### ⚙️ Configuration (Docker Setup)

To enable the Bookdrop feature in Docker:

```yaml
services:
  booklore:
    ...
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
      - ./books:/books
      - ./bookdrop:/bookdrop # 👈 Bookdrop directory
```
